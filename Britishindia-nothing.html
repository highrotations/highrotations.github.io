    <td style="width: 750px"><p>British India have been rock and roll slingers for the past ten years, which is not an easy feat. These years have seen the band create a fantastic collection of records that reflect their musical odyssey, both in the studio and out on the stage. And this time is no different - their fifth album ‘Nothing Touches Me’ urges this journey forward, and sees them diving into new territory while remaining perfectly familiar.</p><p>‘Nothing Touches Me’ comes as a new start for the band as they break away from their own album traditions: one word titles and ten tracks each. Singer/guitarist Declan Melia states that even this seemingly small change reflects their intention to do things differently, which could either “make us bigger or blow us up entirely”. This do or die attitude has fuelled this album, and has produced twelve tracks that toe the line between raw rock songs and polished arrangements. The opener Spider Chords is a perfect example of such songwriting - it starts as a delicate and spacious track, and abruptly explodes into a cathartic wall of sound. The juxtaposition between these halves emphasise the blending of the old and new present on the record.</p><p>Their musical arrangements are always amazing, but it’s the lyrics that have always been a highpoint throughout British India’s work. Melia’s ability to turn everyday happenings into unique and poetic imagery is refreshing in the world of product placement and booty. While apparent right through this record, the earnest lyrics stand out on songs like Blame It All On Me and Jay Walker, which narrate stories about falling in and out of love. The guitar driven Blame It All On Me not only showcases the lyrical content, but also their delivery, as the higher register creates bittersweet melodies, before gradually building into an endless chord progression that soars. Similarly, the piano driven Jay Walker is a ballad that uses the simple premise of crossing a road as subtext for deeper themes of human interaction.</p><p>And while the band has demonstrated a growing maturity by using restraint and allowing songs to breathe, it’s just not a British India record without massive choruses. Luckily, this album is brimming with them - the blistering drums, pounding bass lines and screaming guitars all come to a head in songs like the title track Nothing Touches Me, Come Home, and This Is How It Feels, which all emphasise the rawness they still embrace and work with.</p><p>‘Nothing Touches Me’ represents a fork in the road for British India. Will it be their breakout, or will it be their downfall? Only time will tell, but I’m definitely leaning towards the former - it’s an absolute cracker of an album that successfully sways between the delicate and the raw.</p><p><i>Originally written for <a href="http://www.cityandsound.com/" class="hyper">City And Sound</a>.</i></p></td>
