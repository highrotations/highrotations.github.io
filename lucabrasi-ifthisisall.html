        <p>From playing lounge room floors and filthy pubs to releasing their third record, Tasmania’s premier punks Luca Brasi have come a long way since these humble beginnings. Written over the last few years amongst endless touring, album number three ‘If This Is All We’re Going To Be’ signifies a growth from their past two efforts as the band hits their stride in marrying hard hitting and melodic edges.</p>
        
        <p>The album opens with first single <i>Aeroplane</i>, which can only be described as an absolute belter, complete with the weaving guitars and shout along choruses we’ve come to love. While it provides a perfect snapshot of Luca Brasi, it does so without feeling like a rehash of old ideas - the chorus progression caught me be surprise (in a very good way) and little touches like the delayed calm before the storm highlights an attention to detail present throughout the rest of the album. <i>Drop Out</i> is similar to the opener in execution, with a driving intensity propelled by the drums balanced by sparse and melodic phrases.</p>
        
        <p>This eye for every ingredient is doubly apparent in the slow burning <i>Treading Water</i> and <i>Count Me Out</i>, both centred around intricate melodies that echo the self inspecting lyrics narrating highs and lows. <i>While Treading Water</i> is grounded by a gritty bass line, <i>Count Me Out</i> is an airy closer that floats above the rest, aided by both harmonies and understated keys before bringing it back home with a cathartic and raucous refrain. The introspective nature of the record follows each song and fits into the context instead of tacking the spotlight, evident in <i>Overwhelmed / Ill Prepared</i> which feels like a boiling point in the narrative, mirrored by the resounding and urgent arrangement.</p>
        
        <p>Songs like the striding <i>The Cascade Blues</i> and frantic Man, <i>This Is Living</i> help bolster out an album that hits all the marks, feeling both fresh and insipring. ‘If This Is All We’re Going To Be’ isn’t a question, it’s a statement sung loud and proud, proving that Luca Brasi are the best export from Tassie since Cascade.

        <p>'If This Is All We're Going To Be' is out now through Poison City Records.</p>
